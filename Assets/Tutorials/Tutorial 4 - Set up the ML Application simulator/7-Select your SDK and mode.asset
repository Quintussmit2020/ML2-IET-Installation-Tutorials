        m_Untranslated: 'The first time you use Application Simulator, you need to
          make an SDK and target selection:


          <b>Simulator:</b> If you
          do not have a device, the Application Simulator can render graphics to
          a window that is a composite of simulated headset graphics on top of 3D
          geometry of a virtual room. Headpose, controller input, gestures, and similar
          sensory input is simulated through a Graphic User Interface (GUI). The
          3D geometry in the virtual room services world reconstruction requests
          (meshing, planes, raycast). When iterating using the Simulator, your app''s
          content is composited together with a depiction of your virtual room and
          rendered to the Device View.

          more</a>


          <b>Your Device:</b> If you have a device, the Application
          Simulator can stream the rendered frames to the headset. Headpose, controller
          input, gestures, and similar sensory input is sent from the device to the
          computer. You are able to effectively preview the app without needing to
          go through a time-consuming build and deploy process.

          <b>Hybrid:</b> Combines the power of infinite test
          scenarios within the Simulator with the responsiveness of the physical
          device sensors. Headpose, controller input, hand tracking, eye gaze, and
          similar sensory input is sent from the device to the computer and is mirrored
          in the virtual room. World reconstruction requests continue to make use
          of 3D geometry in the virtual room.
